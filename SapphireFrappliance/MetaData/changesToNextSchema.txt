Since changing the schema is a bit of a pain, here are the items to add to the next schema.

Code is present but commented out with //AAA:
Ã	Add movieSortTitle to XMLData

Ã Add an NSDictionary to every object to allow these changes to be made immediately and then made properties in the future.
Change translations (and importers to match):
Ã	TV and Movies (not posters):
Ã		showPath and IMDBLink or renamed to url and become full URLs
Ã		Add identifier for importer used
Ã		Add id for movie/series (tt#### for IMDB, numeric for for tvrage)
Ã	Movies:
Ã		IMPLink is removed

Ideas:
Add watched/favorite keys to directories, movies, episodes, and virtual directories
	change watched/favorite to use sets of strings, to accommodate multiple users.
Ã Add a date-added field to files so sorting by date-added can be done
